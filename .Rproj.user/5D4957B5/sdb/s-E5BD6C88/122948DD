There are 98 sets of trade data on Enigma, so we chose to narrow our scope of inquiry to three categories: aircraft and spacecraft trade, arms and ammunition trade, and the trade of leather goods. One of the benefits of using this data is that the data sets have a uniform format, which helps with data blending and comparing the data sets. \n\nAccording to Enigma, where we obtained this data, over 140 countries contribute their international trade data to the United Nations Statistics Division. The division has more than 1 billion trade records spanning over 60 years of time from 1962 to the present.\n\n###Each data set has the following columns:###\n\n**Country_Area** - The name of the country engaged in trade\n\n**Year** - The year in which the trade took place\n\n**Comm_Code** - The specific code for the commodity being traded\n\n**Commodity** - A description of the commodity being traded\n\n**Flow** - Indicator of whether the goods were imported or exported from the country\n\n**Trade_USD** - The amount of money that changed hands during the trade\n\n**Weight** - The weight of the goods that were traded in kilograms\n\n**Quantity** - The approximate number of items traded\n\n**Quantity_Name** - Indicator of whether the number in the quantity column is the number of items or the weight of the traded commodities\n\n**SerialID** - The unique serial number given to each trade, starting at 101 and increasing by one per trade until the final recorded trade in the data.\n\nBecause there are so many records in the data we are examining, we have decided to narrow our focus even more and analyze how the United States fits into the global trade of the three previously mentioned commodities. Below we have created some visualizations to show where the US stands on the global commodities trade landscape.\n\n###Here is a summary of the data that we are using.\n```{r}\nsource(\"../01 Data/FinalProjectData.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n##Data Wrangling\n\n###Using data wrangling to show the ratio of a country's total trades in a particular commodity to that of the USA.\nThe wranglings we decided to do consist of first counting the number of individual trades, not individual trade iteams, for each country in the three commodities we selected to focus on (Aircraft, ammo and article leather respectively). Then we divided that total for each country for a particular commodity, by the total that the USA had for that commodity in order to give a ratio. As we found, the USA did not have the top spot in any of the three commodities we chose to look at. And that there was often very little room between the USA and curtain other countries. Both imports and exports were counted in these numbers.\n```{r}\nsource(\"../02 Data Wrangling/FinalProjectWranglings.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n##Visualizing these trade ratios.\n\nWe made visualizations for our data wrangling sets to better illustrate our findings. The visualizations are basically bar charts. The first visualization shows countries that have a ratio of their total number of aircraft trades to the total number of USA aircraft trades greater than .71. The second visualization shows countries that have a ratio of their total number of ammo trades to the total number of USA aircraft trades greater than .705. The third visualization shows countries that have a ratio of their total number of leather trades to the total number of USA leather trades greater than .9. These ratios were chosen in order to clean up the visualizations. \n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../03 Visualizations/FinalProjectVisualizations.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n##Trade Rankings Based on USD\n\nWhat is below are the head() of the data frames containing the rankings of the countries determined by united state's dollar amount (USD), from both imports and exports, for aircraft, ammo and leather trades.\n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../01 Data/CTFPD.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```",
